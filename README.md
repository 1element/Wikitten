Wikitten
========

Wikitten is a small, fast, PHP wiki, and the perfect place to store your notes, code snippets, ideas, etc.

This is a slightly modified fork of Wikitten to fit my needs.

Changes:

* ability to create new pages
* modified layout (mostly no border radius)

For more information about Wikitten check out the [project website of the original version](http://wikitten.vizuina.com).
